# Random Names Generator

`Random` is a PHP class capable of generating millions of random name combinations (first names and surnames) for use as demo data in applications and other projects.

## Acknowledgment

This class is based on the original project [PHP Random Name Generator](https://github.com/edwardr/php-random-name-generator) by [edwardr](https://github.com/edwardr), and it uses list of names with most of the PHP code rewritten and expanded.

## Requirements

PHP 5.3+
